                <h2>Great Barrier Reef faces its biggest threat in centuries</h2>
                <p>New research reveals that the Great Barrier Reef and surrounding waters have experienced the hottest temperatures in over 400 years due to climate change, posing an existential threat to this natural wonder. Without immediate action to curb planetary warming, the survival of the reef is at risk.</p>
                <p>The findings highlight the urgent need for global efforts to combat climate change, as the rapid increase in temperatures poses a severe risk to one of the Earth's most significant ecosystems. The potential loss of the Great Barrier Reef would have devastating consequences for marine biodiversity and ecosystems.</p>
